# VAnimations
A library for animating single variables over time using easings methods or own methods.

This system works by animating single variables over time using an AnimationManager. For now only f32 values can be used, because Generics for some reason refuse to participate.

To get started just import the library and create a new AnimationManager using `animations.new_animation_manager(true)`.

Check out animations.v for methods to use.

Please note that this project is still WIP.
